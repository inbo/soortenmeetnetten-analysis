# English abstract {.unnumbered}

The species monitoring programme ([meetnetten.be](www.meetnetten.be)) aims at collecting reliable information on priority species in Flanders.
It consists of a series of monitoring schemes which were designed by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO).
Species are counted by volunteers in a standardized way under the coordination of the NGO Natuurpunt.

This report presents the initial results of the amphibian monitoring networks for the period 2016â€“2024.
During this period, we observed:

-   a strong increase in midwife toad and fire salamander

-   an increase in tree frog and natterjack toad

-   a possible increase in great crested newt

The strong increase in midwife toad populations can partly be explained by the release of captive-bred individuals.
Continued monitoring is needed to determine whether this increase is sustainable.

The trend for common spadefoot toad remains uncertain.

Moor frog and pool frog are two difficult-to-survey species for which a monitoring protocol has been tested in a pilot project.
The monitoring protocol for moor frog was evaluated positively and will be continued.
For pool frog, adjustments to the monitoring protocol are still needed.
