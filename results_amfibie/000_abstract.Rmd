# English abstract {.unnumbered}

The species monitoring programme ([meetnetten.be](www.meetnetten.be)) of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) and the Nature and Forest Agency (ANB) aims at collecting reliable information on priority species in Flanders.
The list of priority species includes 8 amphibians: 7 Natura 2000 species (European priority species) and 1 species (fire salamander) of regional importance (Flemish priority species).

Most species are counted by volunteers in a standardized way under the coordination of the NGO Natuurpunt.

This report presents the initial results of the amphibian monitoring schemes for the period 2016â€“2024.
During this period, we observed:

-   a strong increase in midwife toad, fire salamander and natterjack toad

-   an increase in tree frog

-   a possible increase in great crested newt

The strong increase in midwife toad populations can partly be explained by the release of captive-bred individuals.
Continued monitoring is needed to determine whether this increase is sustainable.

The natterjack toad is a pioneer species that naturally exhibits strong fluctuations.
For now, we are seeing a significant increase, but a longer time series is needed to gain a clearer view of the trend.

The trend for common spadefoot toad remains uncertain.
However, since the species only occurs in a few locations in Flanders, the conservation status is very unfavourable.
In the comming years, monitoring will reveal if the release of captive-bred individuals is succesfull.

Moor frog and pool frog are two difficult-to-survey species for which a monitoring protocol has been tested in a pilot project.
The monitoring protocol for moor frog was evaluated positively and will be continued.
For pool frog, adjustments to the monitoring protocol are still needed.
